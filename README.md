# PFM.ai

Vietnamese personal-finance app. Current target: Expo Go preview through Phases
1–3. The application is under construction, not ready for real financial data.

## Structure

- `apps/mobile/src`: main Expo SDK 58 application source.
- `packages/domain/src`: pure TypeScript business rules.
- `packages/contracts/src`: shared validation/types.
- `spikes/expo-go`: preserved technical prototype; not part of the workspace.
- `plan.md`: product requirements and owner-approved exceptions.
- `docs/progress.md`: completed checks and outstanding work.

## Install from the project root

Node.js 24 and pnpm 10.33.4. If pnpm is not installed, use its pinned version
through npm without changing global tools:

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'C:\Users\Silentboiz\Desktop\Working\PFM.ai'
npx.cmd --yes pnpm@10.33.4 install
```

This creates the workspace links and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Do not run `npm install`
inside individual workspace packages: their `workspace:*` dependencies require
workspace-aware installation. Review and preserve the generated lockfile.

The owner selected React Native Paper, Zustand and React Hook Form for the
application, together with direct Expo SQLite. Install these SDK-compatible
app dependencies through Expo from the root after the workspace install:

```powershell
npx.cmd --yes pnpm@10.33.4 --filter @pfm/mobile exec expo install expo-sqlite react-native-paper zustand react-hook-form @expo/vector-icons --pnpm
```

`@expo/vector-icons` supplies icons for Paper. No provider keys are required.

## Main application

After installation, run from the root:

```powershell
npx.cmd --yes pnpm@10.33.4 start
```

This launches `apps/mobile` in Expo Go mode. Sign in to the same Expo account on
the CLI and iPhone when prompted. Keep devices on the same reachable network.
The main app now has Vietnamese navigation, optional initial cash balance,
SQLite persistence, wallet/category management, manual income/expense/transfer
create/edit/delete with undo, local disconnected chat, and typed confirmation
before deleting preview data. Monthly budgets and local alert integration are
implemented; goals, recurring entries, debt and remaining Phase 2 features are pending.

From the overview, choose `Quản lý ví` to manage wallets. Archived wallets remain
available under `Đã lưu trữ`; the overview total explicitly covers active wallets.

From `Cài đặt`, choose `Quản lý danh mục` for the two-level category tree. Create,
rename, choose an icon/color, or archive a category. Archiving a parent includes
its children; transaction reassignment requires explicit selection. Category
statistics will show parent totals only when the statistics feature is built.

From `Giao dịch`, add income/expense/transfers, edit, or confirm deletion. Undo
restores the most recent deletion until another successful write, tab change or
reload. Future dates show a warning from tomorrow but can still be saved. Dates
currently use YYYY-MM-DD text entry; manual transactions use Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh.
See [transaction device checks](docs/testing/T2.3-transactions.md).

Choose `Giao dịch → Tìm kiếm và lọc` to search notes without Vietnamese accents
and combine date, kind, wallet, category (including children) and amount filters.
Apply/reset is explicit. Schema version 2 adds/backfills derived note_search while
keeping original notes; existing snapshot/rollback safeguards remain in use.
See [search/upgrade device checks](docs/testing/T2.4-search.md).

From `Ngân sách`, set overall/category monthly limits, edit or pause them, and
switch months. In-app warnings appear only here. Expand `Thông báo ngân sách`
to request permission or schedule a five-second local test, then return to the
phone home screen to observe it. Foreground OS banners are suppressed; actual
notifications can be seen in the system notification list. expo-notifications
58.1.6 is included; no push server/token is used. See
[budget/device checks](docs/testing/T2.5-budgets.md).

Open Overview > Mục tiêu tiết kiệm to create/edit/archive/restore savings goals. Track
progress from a selected wallet's balance or a manually entered amount. A deadline
adds a rounded-up monthly saving amount; tracking does not move or reserve money.
See [goal/device checks](docs/testing/T2.6-goals.md).

Open Transactions > Giao dịch định kỳ to create/edit/pause/resume recurring rules.
Generation catches up on open/resume, up to 366 occurrence dates per run. Archived
references block until restored; explicit resume skips the paused period. Local
reminders target 09:00 Vietnam one day before due, replenished on app open/resume
in a finite window. See [recurring/device checks](docs/testing/T2.7-recurring.md).

Open Transactions > Vay và cho vay to record borrowed/lent principal and repayments.
Debt cash flows change wallet balances, not income/expense totals. Overpayments
are rejected, and deleting/undoing a payment recalculates outstanding/status.
Optional due-date reminders target 09:00 Vietnam the preceding day. See
[debt/device checks](docs/testing/T2.9-debts.md).

Overview includes month income/expense/net, parent-category spending, six-month
charts, budget amounts, current goals and recent selected-month transactions.
Charts include exact text equivalents. Budget threshold warnings remain only in
Budgets. See [dashboard/device checks](docs/testing/T2.8-dashboard.md).

Follow [the iPhone check list](docs/testing/phase-1-expo-go.md) to verify persistence,
dark mode, keyboard behavior and deletion on the device. Owner confirms main-app
wallet add/edit/save on iPhone SE 3; remaining device acceptance is pending.

The previous spike is still runnable independently from `spikes/expo-go` with
`npx.cmd expo start --go`. Stop one development server before starting the other
if both try to use the same port. Database files are not copied between them.

## Checks

```powershell
npx.cmd --yes pnpm@10.33.4 check
```

Runs lint, strict type checking and Vitest. `format:check` checks formatting.
These require installed workspace dependencies. A command being configured does
not mean its checks have run; actual results are in `docs/progress.md`.

## Preview limitations

Local SQLite is authorized to be unencrypted temporarily. This preview explicitly
refuses startup outside Expo Go to avoid shipping plaintext in a later native
build. Native encryption, Face ID, Drive backup and Android device acceptance
remain deferred. AI chat stores local messages with no provider connection or
generated answers. The owner deferred PIN in Expo Go after a measured 44-second
derivation: the preview opens directly and hides PIN controls, preserving existing
PIN/data. PIN enforcement remains enabled outside Expo Go, where the plaintext
database connection still refuses startup. Native PIN performance, the original
post-save error and app-switcher concealment remain pending. Do not enter
real sensitive information in this development preview.
